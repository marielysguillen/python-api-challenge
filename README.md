# python-api-challenge
Python requests, APIs, and JSON
This challenge is a visual analysis and has two parts to predict the most pleasant vacation locations based on weather, humidity, and other factors. The WeatherPy directory contains Jupiter files to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. I utilized OpenWeatherMap_API Python library created a representative model of weather of world cities. I also used the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API to plan future vacations.
The output_data directory contains the results exported in City_Data.csv, and scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
•	Latitude vs. Temperature
•	Latitude vs. Humidity
•	Latitude vs. Cloudiness
•	Latitude vs. Wind Speed
